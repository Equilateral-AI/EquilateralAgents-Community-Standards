title: Agent Trust & Reputation Scoring
description: |
  Trust scoring patterns for multi-agent systems including outcome-based
  scoring, tier-based privilege management, trust decay, and reputation-driven
  rate limiting.

rules:
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Assign initial trust scores to new agents at the standard tier, not trusted - trust must be earned through successful outcomes"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Track per-agent outcomes and adjust trust scores: successful task completion (+), denied/blocked actions (-), warnings (-)"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Implement 4 trust tiers with corresponding privileges: trusted (expanded access), standard (normal), probation (restricted), untrusted (read-only)"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Apply trust decay for inactive agents - trust scores decrease toward baseline over time without positive activity"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Adjust rate limits based on trust tier - higher trust allows more operations per time window"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Persist trust scores across sessions - reputation should compound, not reset"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Allow agents to modify their own trust scores or tier assignments"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Allow untrusted agents to write to shared resources, execute tools, or spawn sub-agents"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Promote agents more than one tier at a time - trust escalation must be gradual"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Automatic demotion on repeated failures over manual intervention"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Transparent trust scoring (agents can read their own score) over opaque scoring"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Trust scores that weight recent outcomes more heavily than historical ones"

anti_patterns:
  - "All agents start at maximum trust - bypasses the earn-trust principle and removes incentive for reliable behavior"
  - "No consequence for failed operations - trust scores never decrease, removing accountability"
  - "Trust resets between sessions - agents lose all earned reputation, preventing long-term reliability tracking"
  - "Untrusted agents with full write access - defeats the purpose of tiered privilege management"
  - "Self-reported trust scores - agents can inflate their own reputation without external validation"
  - "No gradual demotion - agents jump from trusted to untrusted without intermediate corrective steps"

  trust_tier_table: |
    # Trust Tiers, Privileges, and Rate Limits
    # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # Tier        Score Range  Privileges              Rate Limit
    # trusted     80-100       expanded access,        100 ops/min
    #                          spawn sub-agents,
    #                          write shared resources
    # standard    50-79        normal tool access,     50 ops/min
    #                          read/write own scope
    # probation   25-49        restricted tools,       20 ops/min
    #                          read + limited write
    # untrusted   0-24         read-only access,       5 ops/min
    #                          no tool execution

    function adjustTrustScore(agent, outcome) {
      const weights = {
        task_success:    +3,
        task_failure:    -2,
        action_denied:   -5,
        warning_issued:  -1,
        idle_decay:      -0.1  // per hour of inactivity
      };
      const recencyMultiplier = 1.0 / (1 + daysSinceLastAction(agent) * 0.05);
      const delta = weights[outcome] * recencyMultiplier;
      agent.trustScore = clamp(agent.trustScore + delta, 0, 100);
      agent.tier = computeTier(agent.trustScore);
      persistTrustScore(agent);
    }

context: |
  Derived from agent governance patterns in multi-agent orchestration systems.
  In systems where multiple agents operate concurrently, trust scoring provides
  a mechanism to reward reliable agents with expanded access while restricting
  agents that demonstrate unreliable or harmful behavior. Trust must be earned
  through demonstrated outcomes, not assumed. The tier system ensures that
  privilege escalation is gradual and that agents cannot self-promote. Trust
  decay prevents stale high scores from granting unearned access to dormant
  agents.
