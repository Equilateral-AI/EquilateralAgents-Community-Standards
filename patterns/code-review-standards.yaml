title: Code Review Standards & Checklist
description: |
  Six-step review process covering functionality, security, performance,
  code quality, tests, and documentation. Structured approach to
  constructive and thorough code reviews.

rules:
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Follow the 6-step review: understand context, review functionality, review code quality, review security, review performance, review tests"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Check for input validation, SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, and authentication/authorization on every review"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Verify new code has tests, tests cover edge cases, and all tests pass before approving"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Check for N+1 query problems, unnecessary loops, missing indexes, and memory leaks in performance review"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Verify commit messages are clear, no merge conflicts, branch is up to date, and no unnecessary files committed"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Approve a PR without reading the code - rubber-stamp reviews miss bugs and security issues"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Give vague feedback like 'this looks wrong' - explain what the problem is, why, and suggest a fix"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Ignore security issues because they seem minor - small security gaps compound into exploitable vulnerabilities"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Review small PRs (under 400 lines) - large PRs get superficial reviews and miss more bugs"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Check tests first to understand intent, then review implementation against the test expectations"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Use automated tools (linters, formatters, security scanners) to catch style issues so reviews focus on logic"

anti_patterns:
  - "Rubber-stamping reviews - approving without reading defeats the purpose"
  - "Reviewing when tired or distracted - miss critical issues"
  - "Vague feedback without explanation or suggested fix"
  - "Focusing on style nits while missing logic errors or security issues"
  - "Reviewing 1000+ line PRs in a single session - diminishing returns after ~400 lines"

examples:
  review_checklist: |
    Pre-Review:
    [ ] Read PR description and linked issues
    [ ] Check CI/CD status

    Functionality:
    [ ] Solves stated problem
    [ ] Edge cases handled
    [ ] Error handling appropriate

    Security:
    [ ] Inputs validated
    [ ] No SQL injection, XSS
    [ ] No hardcoded secrets
    [ ] Auth/authz correct

    Performance:
    [ ] No N+1 queries
    [ ] No unnecessary loops
    [ ] Caching appropriate

    Code Quality:
    [ ] Readable and clear
    [ ] Functions small and focused
    [ ] No dead code

    Tests:
    [ ] New code has tests
    [ ] Edge cases covered
    [ ] All tests pass

context: |
  Code review is a quality gate that catches bugs, security issues, and
  design problems before they reach production. The six-step process ensures
  comprehensive coverage. Security review is non-optional - most vulnerabilities
  are introduced through code changes that weren't reviewed for security
  implications. Small PRs (under 400 lines) get more thorough reviews.
  Constructive feedback explains the problem, the impact, and a suggested fix.
