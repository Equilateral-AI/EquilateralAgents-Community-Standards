title: Accessibility & WCAG 2.2 Compliance
description: |
  WCAG 2.2 AA/AAA compliance patterns including semantic HTML, keyboard
  navigation, ARIA, color contrast, focus management, screen reader
  support, and mobile accessibility.

rules:
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Use semantic HTML elements (button, nav, main, header, form) before reaching for ARIA roles"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Provide text alternatives for all non-text content - alt text on images, aria-label on icon buttons"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible with visible focus indicators - never remove outline"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Meet color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18pt+), 3:1 for UI components (WCAG AA)"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Implement skip navigation links as the first focusable element to bypass repetitive content"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Trap focus inside modal dialogs and close on Escape key - use role=dialog with aria-modal=true"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Set aria-required, aria-invalid, and aria-describedby on form fields - link error messages to their fields"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Ensure minimum touch target size of 24x24px (WCAG 2.2 AA) or 44x44px (AAA) for interactive elements"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Remove focus outlines without providing an alternative visible focus indicator"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Use color alone to convey information - always provide a secondary indicator (icon, text, pattern)"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Auto-play media without user initiation - provide explicit play controls"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Use aria-live regions to announce dynamic content changes to screen readers - polite for updates, assertive for errors"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Respect prefers-reduced-motion and prefers-contrast media queries for user preference adaptation"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Test with real screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA) and keyboard-only navigation, not just automated tools"

anti_patterns:
  - "Missing alt text on images - screen readers announce the filename instead"
  - "Removing CSS outline on focus without providing alternative focus styles"
  - "Keyboard traps where focus gets stuck in a component with no way to Tab out"
  - "Missing labels on form inputs - screen readers cannot identify the field purpose"
  - "Using div and span for interactive elements instead of native button and a elements"
  - "Tab order that does not match visual layout order confusing keyboard users"
  - "Color contrast below 4.5:1 making text unreadable for low-vision users"

examples:
  accessible_form_field: |
    <label htmlFor="email">
      Email address
      <span aria-hidden="true" className="text-red-500">*</span>
      <span className="sr-only">(required)</span>
    </label>
    <input id="email" type="email"
      aria-required="true"
      aria-invalid={!!errors.email}
      aria-describedby={errors.email ? "email-error" : "email-hint"} />
    {errors.email
      ? <p id="email-error" role="alert">{errors.email}</p>
      : <p id="email-hint">We'll never share your email.</p>}

  skip_navigation: |
    <!-- First focusable element in DOM -->
    <a href="#main-content" className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only focus:absolute">
      Skip to main content
    </a>
    <nav aria-label="Main navigation">...</nav>
    <main id="main-content" tabIndex={-1}>...</main>

  live_region: |
    <!-- Always in DOM, announce dynamic changes -->
    <div role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true" className="sr-only">
      {searchResults.length} results found
    </div>

context: |
  Web accessibility ensures content is usable by people with disabilities
  including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. WCAG 2.2
  (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) defines four principles: Perceivable,
  Operable, Understandable, Robust. Level AA is the standard legal requirement
  in most jurisdictions (ADA, EAA, Section 508). Semantic HTML provides
  accessibility for free - native button, input, and nav elements have built-in
  keyboard and screen reader support. ARIA should supplement, not replace,
  semantic HTML. Automated tools (axe, Lighthouse) catch ~30% of issues -
  manual testing with keyboard and screen readers is essential.
