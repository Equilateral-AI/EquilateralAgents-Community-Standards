title: SLO, Error Budgets & Observability
description: |
  Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs),
  error budget policies, multi-window burn rate alerting, and
  Prometheus/Grafana implementation patterns.

rules:
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Define SLIs that measure user-perceived reliability - availability (success ratio), latency (requests under threshold), durability (successful writes)"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Set achievable SLO targets below 100% - use error budgets to balance reliability investment against feature velocity"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Use 28-day rolling windows for SLO evaluation, not calendar months"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Implement multi-window burn rate alerts (fast: 14.4x/1h AND 5m, slow: 6x/6h AND 30m) to reduce false positives"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Define graduated error budget policy: normal at 100%, caution at 50%, freeze non-critical at 10%, full freeze at 0%"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Track error budget consumption continuously and include in weekly/monthly reliability reviews"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Set SLO target at 100% - it leaves zero error budget for deployments, experiments, or maintenance"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Alert on single-window metrics only - pair long windows with short windows to suppress transient spikes"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Define SLIs based on internal metrics (CPU, memory) instead of user-facing signals (request success, latency)"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Start with SLOs on user-facing services before internal services"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Use Prometheus recording rules for SLI calculations to avoid expensive queries on dashboards and alerts"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Automate SLO reporting and include error budget status in deployment readiness checks"

anti_patterns:
  - "100% availability SLO leaving zero room for planned maintenance, deployments, or experiments"
  - "Single-window alerts that fire on transient spikes causing alert fatigue"
  - "SLIs measuring server CPU instead of user-experienced latency and availability"
  - "No error budget policy - SLO violations have no consequence for development velocity"
  - "Manual SLO tracking in spreadsheets instead of automated Prometheus/Grafana dashboards"
  - "Calendar month SLO windows that reset mid-incident giving false sense of budget"

examples:
  availability_sli: |
    # Prometheus recording rule
    - record: sli:http_availability:ratio
      expr: |
        sum(rate(http_requests_total{status!~"5.."}[28d]))
        /
        sum(rate(http_requests_total[28d]))

  burn_rate_alert: |
    # Multi-window: fast burn (14.4x over 1h, confirmed by 5m)
    - alert: SLOErrorBudgetBurnFast
      expr: |
        slo:burn_rate_1h > 14.4
        and
        slo:burn_rate_5m > 14.4
      for: 2m
      labels:
        severity: critical

  error_budget_policy: |
    Budget Remaining | Action
    100%             | Normal development velocity
    50%              | Postpone risky changes
    10%              | Freeze non-critical changes
    0%               | Feature freeze, reliability focus only

  availability_table: |
    SLO %   | Downtime/Month  | Downtime/Year
    99%     | 7.2 hours       | 3.65 days
    99.9%   | 43.2 minutes    | 8.76 hours
    99.95%  | 21.6 minutes    | 4.38 hours
    99.99%  | 4.32 minutes    | 52.56 minutes

context: |
  SLOs (Service Level Objectives) are the foundation of Site Reliability
  Engineering. SLIs measure what users experience. SLOs set targets for those
  measurements. Error budgets (1 - SLO target) quantify acceptable unreliability
  and create a shared language between development and operations. Multi-window
  burn rate alerting (from Google SRE) reduces false positives by requiring both
  a long window (sustained problem) and short window (still happening) to exceed
  thresholds. The 14.4x and 6x burn rates are standard values that consume 2%
  and 5% of monthly budget per hour/6 hours respectively.
