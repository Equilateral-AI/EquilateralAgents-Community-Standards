title: Incident Postmortem & Blameless Review
description: |
  Blameless postmortem culture, 5 Whys root cause analysis, structured
  postmortem templates, facilitation guidelines, and action item
  tracking patterns.

rules:
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Conduct postmortems for all SEV1/SEV2 incidents, customer-facing outages >15 min, data loss, and security incidents"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Focus on systems not individuals - ask 'what conditions allowed this?' not 'who caused this?'"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Draft the postmortem within 1-2 days while memory is fresh - hold the review meeting within 3-5 days"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Include a precise timeline with timestamps, exact error messages, and supporting metrics/graphs"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Use 5 Whys analysis to identify root causes - keep asking 'why' until you reach systemic issues"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Create concrete action items with owners, due dates, and ticket numbers - no orphan actions"
  - action: ALWAYS
    rule: "Document what went well, what went wrong, and where you got lucky in separate sections"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Name and shame individuals in postmortem documents - blame kills psychological safety and information sharing"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Skip postmortems for small incidents - they reveal patterns that predict larger failures"
  - action: NEVER
    rule: "Create action items without owners and due dates - unowned actions never get completed"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Share postmortems widely across the organization for collective learning"
  - action: PREFER
    rule: "Review postmortem action item completion quarterly and track patterns across incidents"

anti_patterns:
  - "Blame game - focusing on who made the mistake instead of why the system allowed it"
  - "Shallow analysis - stopping at the proximate cause without asking why 5 times"
  - "No action items - discussing the incident without committing to concrete improvements"
  - "Unrealistic action items that never get completed - scope to achievable tasks"
  - "No follow-up - creating tickets but never verifying they were completed"
  - "Postmortem written weeks later when details have faded from memory"

examples:
  five_whys: |
    Problem: Payment service 47-minute outage
    Why 1: Database connections exhausted
    Why 2: Each request opened a new connection (bypassed pool)
    Why 3: Code refactor changed connection acquisition method
    Why 4: Code review focused on business logic, missed infra change
    Why 5: No automated tests for connection pool behavior

    Root causes:
    1. Missing infrastructure behavior tests (prevention)
    2. Code review checklist missing infra considerations (detection)
    3. No canary deployment to catch under real traffic (mitigation)

  action_item_format: |
    | Priority | Action                                  | Owner  | Due        | Ticket   |
    |----------|-----------------------------------------|--------|------------|----------|
    | P0       | Add connection pool integration test    | @alice | 2024-01-22 | ENG-1234 |
    | P1       | Lower DB connection alert threshold     | @bob   | 2024-01-17 | OPS-567  |
    | P2       | Evaluate canary deployment strategy     | @charlie| 2024-02-15 | ENG-1235 |

  postmortem_timeline: |
    Day 0:     Incident occurs
    Day 1-2:   Draft postmortem document
    Day 3-5:   Postmortem meeting (60 min)
    Day 5-7:   Finalize document, create tickets
    Week 2+:   Action item completion
    Quarterly: Review patterns across incidents

context: |
  Blameless postmortems are the foundation of organizational learning from
  incidents. Google SRE, Etsy, and PagerDuty have proven that blame-focused
  cultures suppress information sharing while blameless cultures improve
  reliability. The 5 Whys technique drives past symptoms to systemic root
  causes. Three sections (what went well, what went wrong, where we got lucky)
  provide balanced perspective. Action items must be tracked in the ticketing
  system with owners and due dates. Quarterly pattern reviews across incidents
  reveal systemic weaknesses.
